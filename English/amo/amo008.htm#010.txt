King James Version: Amos Chapter
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a  of summer .

 And he said, , what seest thou? And I said, A  of summer . Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of ; I will not again pass by them any more.

 And the  of the  shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

 Hear this, O ye that  up the needy, even to make the  of the land to fail,

 Saying, When will the new  be gone, that we may sell ? and the , that we may set forth , making the  small, and the  great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?

 That we may buy the  for , and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the ?

 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of , Surely I will never forget any of their works.

 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one  that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a ; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the  of .

 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the  to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:

 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your  into ; and I will bring up  upon all loins, and  upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a  day.

 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a  in the land, not a  of , nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.

 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

 They that swear by the  of , and say, Thy god, O , liveth; and, The manner of  liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
