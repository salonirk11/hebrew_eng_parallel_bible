 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.

 Cursed shall be thy  and thy store.

 Cursed shall be the  of thy body, and the  of thy land, the increase of thy , and the flocks of thy .

 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.

 Thou shalt  a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

 Thine  shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine  shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy  shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

 The  of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:

 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore  that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.

 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy  which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods,  and .

 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.

 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a  of  upon thy , until he have destroyed thee.

 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the  flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;

 So that he will not give to any of them of the  of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.

 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her , and toward her son, and toward her daughter,

 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.

 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of , which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none  of thy life:

 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

 And the LORD shall bring thee into  again with , by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
