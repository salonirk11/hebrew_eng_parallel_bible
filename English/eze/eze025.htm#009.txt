King James Version: Ezekiel Chapter
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, , against my , when it was profaned; and against the land of , when it was desolate; and against the house of , when they went into ;

 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the  for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their  in thee: they shall eat thy , and they shall  thy .

 And I will make  a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of ;

 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the ; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that  and  do say, Behold, the house of  is like unto all the ;

 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of  from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the  of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

 Unto the men of the  with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

 And I will execute judgments upon ; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that  hath dealt against the house of  by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;

 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon , and will cut off man and  from it; and I will make it desolate from ; and they of  shall fall by the .

 And I will lay my vengeance upon  by the hand of my people : and they shall do in  according to mine  and according to my ; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.

 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the  have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old ;

 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the , and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
