King James Version: Hosea Chapter
When  was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of .

 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto , and burned  to graven images.

 I taught  also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.

 I drew them with cords of a man, with  of love: and I was to them as they that take off the  on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

 He shall not return into the land of , and the Assyrian shall be his , because they refused to return.

 And the  shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

 How shall I give thee up, ? how shall I deliver thee, ?  how shall I make thee as ? how shall I set thee as ? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.

 I will not execute the fierceness of mine , I will not return to destroy : for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.

 They shall tremble as a  out of , and as a  out of the land of : and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.

  compasseth me about with lies, and the house of  with deceit: but  yet ruleth with God, and is  with the saints.
