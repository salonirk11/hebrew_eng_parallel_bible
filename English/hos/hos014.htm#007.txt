King James Version: Hosea Chapter
O , return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.

  shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth .

 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine  is turned away from him.

 I will be as the  unto : he shall grow as the , and cast forth his roots as .

 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the  tree, and his smell as .

 They that dwell under his  shall return; they shall revive as the , and grow as the : the scent thereof shall be as the  of .

  shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green  tree. From me is thy  found.

 Who is , and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
