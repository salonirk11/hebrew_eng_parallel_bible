 They stoop, they  down together; they could not deliver the , but themselves are gone into .

 Hearken unto me, O house of , and all the remnant of the house of , which are borne by me from the , which are carried from the womb:

 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from :

 I bring near my ; it shall not be far off, and my  shall not tarry: and I will place  in  for  my .
