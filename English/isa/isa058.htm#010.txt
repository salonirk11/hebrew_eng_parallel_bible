King James Version: Isaiah: Isaiah Chapter
King James Version: Isaiah Chapter
Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of  their sins.

 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did , and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of ; they take delight in approaching to God.

 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your  ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.

 Behold, ye  for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not  as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.

 Is it such a  that I have ? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to  down his head as a , and to spread  and  under him? wilt thou call this a , and an acceptable day to the LORD?

 Is not this the  that I have ? to loose the  of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every ?

 Is it not to deal thy  to the hungry, and that thou bring the  that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the , that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own ?

 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy  shall go before thee; the  of the LORD shall be thy .

 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the , the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;

 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy  be as the noon day:

 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in , and make  thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.

 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the , The restorer of paths to dwell in.

 If thou turn away thy foot from the , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the  a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of  thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
