 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that ;

 To appoint unto them that  in , to give unto them beauty for , the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the  of heaviness; that they might be called trees of , the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the  shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double:  joy shall be unto them.
