King James Version: Isaiah Chapter
I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.

 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;

 A people that provoketh me to  continually to my face; that sacrificeth in , and burneth  upon altars of brick;

 Which remain among the graves, and  in the monuments, which eat swine's , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;

 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.

 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their ,

 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned  upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their .

 Thus saith the LORD, As the new  is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

 And I will bring forth a seed out of , and out of  an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

 And  shall be a  of flocks, and the  of  a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the   unto that number.

 Therefore will I number you to the , and ye shall all  down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall , but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of .

 And ye shall leave your name for a  unto my : for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:

 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall  himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create  a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

 And I will rejoice in , and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.

 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the  of them.

 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

 The  and the  shall feed together, and the lion shall eat  like the : and  shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
