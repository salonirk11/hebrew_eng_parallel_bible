King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter
Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen , and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;

 And go forth unto the  of the son of , which is by the entry of the  , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,

 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of , and inhabitants of ; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.

 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned  in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of , and have filled this place with the  of innocents;

 They have built also the high places of , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto , which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:

 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called , nor The  of the son of , but The  of slaughter.

 And I will make void the counsel of  and  in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the  before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the , and for the beasts of the earth.

 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and  because of all the plagues thereof.

 And I will cause them to eat the  of their sons and the  of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the  of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.

 Then shalt thou break the  in the sight of the men that go with thee,

 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in , till there be no place to bury.

 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as :

 And the houses of , and the houses of the kings of , shall be defiled as the place of , because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned  unto all the  of , and have poured out  offerings unto other gods.

 Then came  from , whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people,

 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.
