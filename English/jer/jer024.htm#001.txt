King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter
The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the  of the LORD, after that   of  had carried away  Jeconiah the son of   of , and the princes of , with the carpenters and smiths, from , and had brought them to .

 One  had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other  had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.

 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, ? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 Thus saith the LORD, the God of ; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away  of , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.

 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.

 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give  the  of , and his princes, and the residue of , that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of :

 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a , a taunt and a , in all places whither I shall drive them.

 And I will send the , the , and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
