King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter
Then all the captains of the , and  the son of , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,

 And said unto  the , Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)

 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.

 Then  the  said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.

 Then they said to , The LORD be a true and   between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.

 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto .

 Then called he  the son of , and all the captains of the  which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,

 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

 Be not afraid of the  of , of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.

 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have  upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.

 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,

 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of , where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of ; and there will we dwell:

 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of ; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into , and go to sojourn there;

 Then it shall come to pass, that the , which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of , and the , whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in ; and there ye shall die.

 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into  to sojourn there; they shall die by the , by the , and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; As mine  and my  hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of ; so shall my  be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into : and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a , and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.

 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of ; Go ye not into : know certainly that I have admonished you this day.

 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.

 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.

 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the , by the , and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
