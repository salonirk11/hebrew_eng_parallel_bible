King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter
And it came to pass, that when  had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,

 Then spake  the son of Hoshaiah, and  the son of , and all the proud men, saying unto , Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into  to sojourn there:

 But  the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into .

 So  the son of , and all the captains of the , and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of .

 But  the son of , and all the captains of the , took all the remnant of , that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of ;

 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that  the captain of the  had left with  the son of  the son of , and  the , and  the son of Neriah.

 So they came into the land of : for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; Behold, I will send and take  the  of , my servant, and will set his  upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal  over them.

 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of , and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for  to ; and such as are for the  to the .

 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of ; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of , as a  putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.

 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of ; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
