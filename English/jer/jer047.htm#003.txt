King James Version: Jeremiah Chapter
The word of the LORD that came to  the  against the , before that  smote .

 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing , and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.

 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;

 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the , and to cut off from Tyrus and  every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the , the remnant of the country of .

  is come upon ;  is cut off with the remnant of their : how long wilt thou cut thyself?

 O thou  of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against , and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
