 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of  shall come, they and the children of  together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

 They shall ask the way to  with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual  that shall not be forgotten.

 My people hath been lost : their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.

 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the  of , even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

 Remove out of the midst of , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.

 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against  an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their  shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

 And  shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.

 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown  as the  at , and bellow as bulls;

 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a , a dry land, and a .

 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by  shall be astonished, and  at all her plagues.

 Put yourselves in array against  round about: all ye that bend the , shoot at her, spare no : for she hath sinned against the LORD.

 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.

 Cut off the sower from , and him that handleth the  in the time of : for fear of the oppressing  they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of ; Behold, I will punish the  of  and his land, as I have punished the  of .

 And I will bring  again to his , and he shall feed on  and , and his soul shall be satisfied upon   and .

 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of  shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of , and they shall not be found: for I will  them whom I reserve.

 Go up against the land of , even against it, and against the inhabitants of : waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great .

 How is the  of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is  become a desolation among the nations!

 I have laid a  for thee, and thou art also taken, O , and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

 The LORD hath opened his , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.

 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of , to declare in  the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his .

 Call together the archers against : all ye that bend the ,  against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of .

 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.

 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.

 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of  and the children of  were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them ; they refused to let them go.

 Their  is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of .

 A  is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of , and upon her princes, and upon her  men.

 A  is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a  is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

 A  is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a  is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.

 A  is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.

 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the  of  unto the  of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a  man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that  that will stand before me?

 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against ; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their  desolate with them.

 At the noise of the taking of  the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
