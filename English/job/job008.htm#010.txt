Then answered  the , and said,

 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert ?

 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;

 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;

 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the  of thy  prosperous.

 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.

 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
