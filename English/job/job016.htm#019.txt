King James Version: Job Chapter
Then Job answered and said,

 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.

 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could  up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.

 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?

 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.

 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a  against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth  to my face.

 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the  reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my , and shaken me to , and set me up for his mark.

 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my  asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my  upon the ground.

 He breaketh me with  upon , he runneth upon me like a giant.

 I have sewed  upon my skin, and defiled my  in the .

 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the  of death;

 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my  is pure.

 O earth, cover not thou my , and let my cry have no place.

 Also now, behold, my  is in , and my record is on high.

 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!

 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
