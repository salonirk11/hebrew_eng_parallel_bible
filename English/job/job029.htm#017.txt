King James Version: Job Chapter
Moreover Job continued his , and said,

 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;

 When his  shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through ;

 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my ;

 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;

 When I washed my steps with , and the  poured me out rivers of oil;

 When I went out to the  through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!

 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.

 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.

 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

 When the  heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave  to me:

 Because I delivered the  that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.

 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

 I put on , and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a .

 I was eyes to the , and feet was I to the lame.

 I was a father to the : and the cause which I knew not I searched out.

 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.

 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.

 My root was spread out by the waters, and the  lay all night upon my .

 My  was fresh in me, and my  was renewed in my hand.

 Unto me men gave , and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.

 And they waited for me as for the ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter .

 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.

 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a  in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
