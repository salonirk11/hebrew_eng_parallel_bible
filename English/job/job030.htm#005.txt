 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?

 For want and  they were solitary; fleeing into the  in former time desolate and waste.

 Who cut up  by the bushes, and  roots for their meat.

 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)

 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.

 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.

 Because he hath loosed my , and afflicted me, they have also let loose the  before me.

 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their .

 My  boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.

 I went mourning without the : I stood up, and I cried in the .

 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

 My  also is turned to mourning, and my  into the voice of them that weep.
