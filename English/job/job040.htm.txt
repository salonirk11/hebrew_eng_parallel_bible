King James Version: Job Chapter
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.

 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.

 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?

 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou  with a voice like him?

 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with  and beauty.

 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.

 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.

 Hide them in the  together; and bind their faces in secret.

 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

 Behold now , which I made with thee; he eateth  as an .

 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his .

 He moveth his tail like a : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.

 His bones are as strong  of ; his bones are like bars of .

 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his  to approach unto him.

 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.

 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the , and fens.

 The shady trees cover him with their ; the  of the  compass him about.

 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up  into his mouth.

 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
