King James Version: Joshua Chapter
Now after the death of  the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto  the son of , Moses' , saying,

  my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this , thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of .

 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto .

 From the  and this  even unto the great river, the river , all the land of the , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the , shall be your coast.

 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with , so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which  my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

 Then  commanded the officers of the people, saying,

 Pass through the , and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this , to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.

 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the  of , spake , saying,

 Remember the word which  the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.

 Your wives, your little ones, and your , shall remain in the land which  gave you on this side ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;

 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which  the LORD's servant gave you on this side  toward the sunrising.

 And they answered , saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

 According as we hearkened unto  in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with .

 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
