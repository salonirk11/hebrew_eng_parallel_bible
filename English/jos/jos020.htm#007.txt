King James Version: Joshua Chapter

 Speak to the children of , saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of :

 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of .

 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the  of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

 And if the avenger of  pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the  for judgment, and until the death of the high  that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

 And they appointed  in  in  , and  in  , and Kirjatharba, which is , in the mountain of .

 And on the other side  by  eastward, they assigned  in the  upon the  out of the  of , and  in  out of the  of , and  in  out of the  of .

 These were the cities appointed for all the children of , and for the  that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of , until he stood before the .
