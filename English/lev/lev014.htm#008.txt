 This is the law of him in whom is the  of , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

 And the LORD spake unto  and unto , saying,

 When ye be come into the land of , which I give to you for a possession, and I put the  of  in a house of the land of your possession;

 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the , saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a  in the house:

 Then the  shall command that they empty the house, before the  go into it to see the , that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the  shall go in to see the house:

 And he shall look on the , and, behold, if the  be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

 Then the  shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house  days:

 And the  shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the  be spread in the walls of the house;

 Then the  shall command that they take away the stones in which the  is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:

 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the  that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:

 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.

 And if the  come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

 Then the  shall come and look, and, behold, if the  be spread in the house, it is a fretting  in the house; it is unclean.

 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.

 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

 And if the  shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the  hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the  shall pronounce the house , because the  is healed.

 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and  , and , and :

 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

 And he shall take the  , and the , and the , and the living , and dip them in the  of the slain , and in the running water, and sprinkle the house  times:

 And he shall cleanse the house with the  of the , and with the running water, and with the living , and with the  , and with the , and with the :

 But he shall let go the living  out of the city into the open fields, and make an  for the house: and it shall be .

 This is the law for all manner of  of , and scall,

 And for the  of a garment, and of a house,

 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is : this is the law of .
