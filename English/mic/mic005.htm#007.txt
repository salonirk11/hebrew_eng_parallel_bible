 But thou,  , though thou be little among the  of , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in ; whose goings forth have been from of old, from .

 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of .

 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him  shepherds, and eight principal men.

 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:

 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more  the work of thine hands.

 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.

 And I will execute vengeance in  and  upon the , such as they have not heard.
