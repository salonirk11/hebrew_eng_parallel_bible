 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

 The LORD is slow to , and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the  of his feet.

 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his ? his  is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
