King James Version: Nahum Chapter
He that dasheth in  is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.

 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of , as the excellency of : for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their  branches.

 The  of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in : the chariots shall be with flaming  in the day of his preparation, and the  trees shall be terribly shaken.

 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like , they shall run like the lightnings.

 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.

 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the  shall be dissolved.

 And Huzzab shall be led away , she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,  upon their breasts.

 But  is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.

 Take ye the spoil of , take the spoil of : for there is none end of the store and  out of all the pleasant furniture.

 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.

 Where is the dwelling of the , and the feedingplace of the young , where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

 The lion did tear in  enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.

 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the  shall devour thy young : and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
