King James Version: Nehemiah Chapter
The words of  the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month , in the twentieth year, as I was in  the ,

 That , one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the , and concerning .

 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the  there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of  also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of ,

 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of , the great and terrible God, that keepeth  and  for them that love him and observe his commandments:

 Let thine  now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the  of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of  thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of , which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.

 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant .

 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant , saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:

 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the , yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have  to set my name there.

 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine  be attentive to the  of thy servant, and to the  of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him  in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
