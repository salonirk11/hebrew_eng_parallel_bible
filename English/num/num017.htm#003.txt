And the LORD spake unto , saying,

 Speak unto the children of , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

 And thou shalt lay them up in the  of the  before the , where I will meet with you.

 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of , whereby they murmur against you.

 And  spake unto the children of , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each  one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of  was among their rods.

 And  laid up the rods before the LORD in the  of .

 And it came to pass, that on the morrow  went into the  of ; and, behold, the rod of  for the house of  was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.

 And  brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of : and they looked, and took every man his rod.

 And the LORD said unto , Bring Aaron's rod again before the , to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

 And  did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

 And the children of  spake unto , saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the  of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
