King James Version: Proverbs Chapter
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the  of thine eye.

 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:

 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the  which flattereth with her words.

 For at the window of my house I looked through my ,

 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an , and subtil of heart.

 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,

 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine  of .

 Till a  strike through his ; as a  hasteth to the , and knoweth not that it is for his life.

 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.

 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.

 Her house is the way to , going down to the chambers of death.
