King James Version: Proverbs Chapter
The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.

 All the ways of a man are  in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.

 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.

 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.

 Every one that is proud in heart is an  to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

 By  and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.

 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.

 Better is a little with  than great revenues without right.

 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

 A divine sentence is in the lips of the : his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.

 A just weight and  are the LORD's: all the  of the  are his work.

 It is an  to kings to commit wickedness: for the  is established by .

 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.

 The wrath of a  is as messengers of death: but a  man will pacify it.

 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a  of the latter .

 How much better is it to get wisdom than ! and to get understanding rather to be  than !

 The  of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

 Pride goeth before , and an haughty  before a fall.

 Better it is to be of an humble  with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.

 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

 The  in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.

 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.

 The heart of the  teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.

 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.

 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.

 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.

 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.

 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.

 The hoary head is a  of , if it be found in the way of .

 He that is slow to  is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his  than he that taketh a city.

 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
