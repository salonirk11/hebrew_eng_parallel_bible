King James Version: Proverbs Chapter
A GOOD name is rather to be  than great riches, and loving favour rather than  and .

 The rich and  meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.

 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.

 By  and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.

 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.

 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

 The rich ruleth over the , and the borrower is servant to the lender.

 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his  shall fail.

 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his  to the .

 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.

 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the  of his lips the  shall be his friend.

 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.

 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.

 The mouth of strange women is a  : he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.

 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.

 He that oppresseth the  to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

  down thine , and hear the words of the , and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.

 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.

 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,

 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?

 Rob not the , because he is : neither oppress the afflicted in the :

 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.

 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:

 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a  to thy soul.

 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.

 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?

 Remove not the ancient , which thy fathers have set.

 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
