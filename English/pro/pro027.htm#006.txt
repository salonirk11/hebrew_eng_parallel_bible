King James Version: Proverbs Chapter
Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a , and not thine own lips.

 A  is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.

 Wrath is cruel, and  is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?

 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

  are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every  thing is sweet.

 As a  that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.

  and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.

 My son, be , and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.

 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.

 Take his garment that is  for a , and take a  of him for a strange woman.

 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a  to him.

 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.

 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the  of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

  sharpeneth ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

 Whoso keepeth the  tree shall eat the  thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.

  and  are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

 As the fining pot for , and the  for ; so is a man to his praise.

 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a  among  with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.

 For riches are not for ever: and doth the  endure to every ?

 The  appeareth, and the tender  sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.

 And thou shalt have goats'  enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
