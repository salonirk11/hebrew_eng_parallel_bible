King James Version: Psalms Chapter
O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy  above the heavens.

 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the  and the , which thou hast ordained;

 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with  and honour.

 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:

 All  and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

 The fowl of the air, and the  of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
