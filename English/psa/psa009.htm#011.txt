I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.

 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.

 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.

 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the  judging right.

 Thou hast rebuked the , thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his  for judgment.

 And he shall  the world in , he shall  judgment to the people in uprightness.

 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in : declare among the people his doings.

 When he maketh inquisition for , he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

 Have  upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the  shall not perish for ever.

 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the  be judged in thy sight.

 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. .
