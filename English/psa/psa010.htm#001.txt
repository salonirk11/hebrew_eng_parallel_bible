King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?

 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.

 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.

 He sitteth in the lurking places of the : in the secret places doth he  the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the .

 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his : he lieth in wait to catch the : he doth catch the , when he draweth him into his .

 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the  may fall by his strong ones.

 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.

 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.

 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the  committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.

 The LORD is  for ever and ever: the  are perished out of his land.

 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine  to hear:

 To  the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
