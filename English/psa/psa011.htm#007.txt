King James Version: Psalms Chapter
In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a  to your mountain?

 For, lo, the wicked bend their , they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

 The LORD is in his holy , the LORD's  is in : his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

 Upon the wicked he shall  snares, fire and , and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their .

 For the righteous LORD loveth ; his countenance doth behold the upright.
