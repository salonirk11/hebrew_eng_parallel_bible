King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.

 The LORD looked down from  upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat , and call not upon the LORD.

 There were they in great fear: for God is in the  of the righteous.

 Ye have shamed the counsel of the , because the LORD is his refuge.

 Oh that the  of  were come out of ! when the LORD bringeth back the  of his people,  shall rejoice, and  shall be glad.
