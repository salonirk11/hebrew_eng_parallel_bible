King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Lord, who shall abide in thy ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh , and speaketh the truth in his heart.

 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.

 He that putteth not out his money to , nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
