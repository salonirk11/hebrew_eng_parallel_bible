King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my  extendeth not to thee;

 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.

 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their  offerings of  will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.

 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my : thou maintainest my lot.

 The  are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

 I will  the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my  also instruct me in the night .

 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

 Therefore my heart is glad, and my  rejoiceth: my  also shall rest in hope.

 For thou wilt not leave my soul in ; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is  of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
