King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The LORD is my ; I shall not want.

 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of  for his name's sake.

 Yea, though I walk through the  of the  of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my  runneth over.

 Surely  and  shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
