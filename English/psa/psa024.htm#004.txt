King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The earth is the LORD's, and the  thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.

 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?

 He that hath  hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and  from the God of his .

 This is the  of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O . .

 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye  ; and the  of  shall come in.

 Who is this  of ? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye  ; and the  of  shall come in.

 Who is this  of ? The LORD of hosts, he is the  of . .
