me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my  and my heart.

 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

 I have hated the  of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine , O LORD:

 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

 LORD, I have loved the  of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.

 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I  the LORD.
