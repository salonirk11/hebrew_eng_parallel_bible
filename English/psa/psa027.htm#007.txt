King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The LORD is my light and my ; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my , they stumbled and fell.

 Though an  should  against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his : in the secret of his  shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a .

 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have  also upon me, and answer me.

 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the  of the LORD in the land of the living.

 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
