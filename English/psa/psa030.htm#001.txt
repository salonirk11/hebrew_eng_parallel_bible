King James Version: Psalms Chapter
I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the : thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the .

 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his .

 For his  endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

 What profit is there in my , when I go down to the ? Shall the  praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

 Hear, O LORD, and have  upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my , and girded me with gladness;

 To the end that my  may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
