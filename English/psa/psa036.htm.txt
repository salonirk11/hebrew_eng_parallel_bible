King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.

 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be , and to do good.

 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

 Thy , O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.

 Thy  is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great : O LORD, thou preservest man and .

 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the  of thy wings.

 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them  of the river of thy pleasures.

 For with thee is the  of life: in thy light shall we see light.

 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy  to the upright in heart.

 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.

 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
