King James Version: Psalms Chapter
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the  thereof. .

 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

 The  raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of  is our refuge. .

 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the , and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the  in the fire.

 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the , I will be exalted in the earth.

 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of  is our refuge. .
