O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great  over all the earth.

 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of  whom he loved. .

 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our , sing praises.

 For God is the  of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.

 God reigneth over the : God sitteth upon the  of his .

 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of : for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
