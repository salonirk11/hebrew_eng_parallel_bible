King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Hear this, all ye people; give , all ye inhabitants of the world:

 Both low and high, rich and , together.

 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

 I will incline mine  to a : I will open my dark saying upon the .

 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?

 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a  for him:

 (For the  of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)

 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

 For he seeth that  men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.

 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.

 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. .

 Like  they are laid in the ; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the  from their dwelling.

 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the : for he shall receive me. .

 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the  of his house is increased;

 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his  shall not descend after him.

 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

 He shall go to the  of his fathers; they shall never see light.

 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
