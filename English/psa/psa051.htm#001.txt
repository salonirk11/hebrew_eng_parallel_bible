King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Have  upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies  out my transgressions.

 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my .

 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my  is ever before me.

 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.

 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in  did my mother conceive me.

 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

 Purge me with , and I shall be : wash me, and I shall be whiter than .

 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.

 Hide thy face from my sins, and  out all mine iniquities.

 Create in me a  heart, O God; and renew a right  within me.

 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy  from me.

 Restore unto me the joy of thy ; and uphold me with thy free .

 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.

 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my : and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy .

 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

 For thou desirest not ; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt .

 The sacrifices of God are a broken : a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

 Do good in thy good pleasure unto : build thou the walls of .

 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of , with burnt  and whole burnt : then shall they offer bullocks upon thine .
