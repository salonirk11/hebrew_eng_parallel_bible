King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Save me, O God, by thy name, and  me by thy strength.

 Hear my , O God; give  to the words of my mouth.

 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. .

 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.

 I will freely  unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.

 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
