King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the  of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.

 He shall send from , and save me from the reproach of him that would  me up. . God shall send forth his  and his truth.

 My soul is among : and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and , and their tongue a sharp .

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy  be above all the earth.

 They have prepared a  for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a  before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. .

 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

 Awake up, my ; awake,  and : I myself will awake early.

 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.

 For thy  is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.

 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy  be above all the earth.
