King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Do ye indeed speak , O ? do ye  uprightly, O ye sons of men?

 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

 Their  is like the  of a : they are like the deaf  that stoppeth her ;

 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.

 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young , O LORD.

 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his  to shoot his , let them be as cut in .

 As a  which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely  of a woman, that they may not see the .

 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the  of the wicked.

 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
