Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in : and unto thee shall the vow be performed.

 O thou that hearest , unto thee shall all  come.

 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.

 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the  of thy house, even of thy holy .

 By terrible things in  wilt thou answer us, O God of our ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

 Which by his strength setteth  the mountains; being girded with power:

 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them , when thou hast so provided for it.

 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.

 Thou crownest the year with thy ; and thy paths drop fatness.

 They drop upon the pastures of the : and the little hills rejoice on every side.

 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with ; they shout for joy, they also sing.
