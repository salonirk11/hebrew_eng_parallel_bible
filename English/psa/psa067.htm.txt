King James Version: Psalms Chapter
God be merciful unto us, and  us; and cause his face to shine upon us; .

 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.

 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt  the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. .

 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall  us.

 God shall  us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
