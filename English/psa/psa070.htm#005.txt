King James Version: Psalms Chapter
MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.

 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, , .

 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy  say continually, Let God be magnified.

 But I am  and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
