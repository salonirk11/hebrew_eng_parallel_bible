King James Version: Psalms Chapter
In  is God known: his name is great in .

 In  also is his , and his dwelling place in .

 There brake he the  of the , the , and the , and the battle. .

 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.

 At thy rebuke, O God of , both the  and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?

 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from ; the earth feared, and was still,

 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. .

 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.

 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

 He shall cut off the  of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
