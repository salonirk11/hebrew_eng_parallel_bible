King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of .

 Take a psalm, and bring hither the , the pleasant  with the .

 Blow up the trumpet in the new , in the time appointed, on our solemn  day.

 For this was a statute for , and a law of the God of .

 This he ordained in  for a , when he went out through the land of : where I heard a language that I understood not.

 I removed his shoulder from the : his hands were delivered from the pots.

 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of : I proved thee at the waters of . .

 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O , if thou wilt hearken unto me;

 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou  any strange god.

 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of : open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and  would none of me.

 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' : and they walked in their own counsels.

 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and  had walked in my ways!

 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.

 He should have fed them also with the finest of the : and with  out of the  should I have satisfied thee.
