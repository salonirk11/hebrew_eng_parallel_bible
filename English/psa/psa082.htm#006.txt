King James Version: Psalms Chapter
God standeth in the  of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.

 How long will ye  unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? .

 Defend the  and fatherless: do  to the afflicted and needy.

 Deliver the  and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in : all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.

 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

 Arise, O God,  the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
