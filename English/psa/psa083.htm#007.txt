King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of  may be no more in remembrance.

 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

 The tabernacles of , and the Ishmaelites; of , and the Hagarenes;

 , and , and ; the  with the inhabitants of ;

 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. .

 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to , as to , at the  of Kison:

 Which perished at : they became as  for the earth.

 Make their nobles like , and like : yea, all their princes as , and as :

 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

 O my God, make them like a ; as the stubble before the wind.

 As the fire burneth a , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is , art the most high over all the earth.
