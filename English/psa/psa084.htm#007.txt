 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my  crieth out for the living God.

 Yea, the  hath found an house, and the  a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my , and my God.

 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. .

 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.

 Who passing through the  of Baca make it a well; the  also filleth the pools.

 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in  appeareth before God.

 O LORD God of hosts, hear my : give , O God of . .

 Behold, O God our , and look upon the face of thine anointed.

 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

 For the LORD God is a  and : the LORD will give  and : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
