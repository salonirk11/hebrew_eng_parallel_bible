 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their . .

 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine .

 Turn us, O God of our , and cause thine  toward us to cease.

 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine  to all generations?

 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

 Shew us thy , O LORD, and grant us thy .

 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.

 Surely his  is nigh them that fear him; that  may dwell in our land.

 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and  shall look down from .

 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.

  shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
