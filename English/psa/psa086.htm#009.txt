King James Version: Psalms Chapter
down thine , O LORD, hear me: for I am  and needy.

 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.

 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in  unto all them that call upon thee.

 Give , O LORD, unto my ; and attend to the voice of my supplications.

 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.

 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.

 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and  before thee, O Lord; and shall  thy name.

 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.

 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.

 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will  thy name for evermore.

 For great is thy  toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest .

 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.

 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in  and truth.

 O turn unto me, and have  upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine .

 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
