King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.

 Clouds and  are round about him:  and judgment are the  of his .

 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.

 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.

 The hills melted like  at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

 The heavens declare his , and all the people see his .

 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols:  him, all ye gods.

  heard, and was glad; and the daughters of  rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.

 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.

 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his .
