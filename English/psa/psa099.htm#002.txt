King James Version: Psalms Chapter
The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

 The LORD is great in ; and he is high above all the people.

 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and  in .

 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and  at his ; for he is holy.

  and  among his priests, and  among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

 He spake unto them in the cloudy : they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

 Exalt the LORD our God, and  at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
