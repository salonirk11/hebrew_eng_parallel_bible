King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the  of his pasture.

 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and  his name.

 For the LORD is good; his  is ; and his truth endureth to all generations.
