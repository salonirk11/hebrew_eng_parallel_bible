King James Version: Psalms Chapter
the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me,  his holy name.

  the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;

 Who redeemeth thy life from ; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

 The LORD executeth  and judgment for all that are oppressed.

 He made known his ways unto , his acts unto the children of .

 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to , and plenteous in .

 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his  for ever.

 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

 For as the  is high above the earth, so great is his  toward them that fear him.

 As far as the  is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.

 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are .

 As for man, his days are as : as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.

 But the  of the LORD is from  to  upon them that fear him, and his  unto children's children;

 To such as keep his , and to those that remember his commandments to do them.

 The LORD hath prepared his  in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

  the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

  ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

  the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:  the LORD, O my soul.
