Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his  endureth for ever.

 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?

 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth  at all times.

 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy ;

 That I may see the good of thy , that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may  with thine inheritance.

 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in ; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.

 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the .

 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.

 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

 But lusted exceedingly in the , and tempted God in the .

 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

 They envied  also in the , and  the saint of the LORD.

 The earth opened and swallowed up  and covered the company of .

 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

 They made a  in , and worshipped the molten image.

 Thus they changed their  into the similitude of an  that eateth .

 They forgat God their , which had done great things in ;

 Wondrous works in the land of , and terrible things by the Red sea.

 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not  his  stood before him in the , to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.

 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the :

 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

 Thus they provoked him to  with their inventions: and the  brake in upon them.

 Then stood up , and executed judgment: and so the  was stayed.

 And that was counted unto him for  unto all generations for evermore.

 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with  for their sakes:

 Because they provoked his , so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

 But were mingled among the , and learned their works.

 And they served their idols: which were a  unto them.

 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

 And shed innocent , even the  of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of : and the land was polluted with .

 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.

 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

 And he gave them into the hand of the ; and they that hated them ruled over them.

 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

 And he remembered for them his , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the , to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

 Blessed be the LORD God of  from  to : and let all the people say, . Praise ye the LORD.
