King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.

 From the rising of the  unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.

 The LORD is high above all nations, and his  above the heavens.

 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in , and in the earth!

 He raiseth up the  out of the , and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;

 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

 He maketh the  woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
