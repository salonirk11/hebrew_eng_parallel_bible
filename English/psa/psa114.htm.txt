King James Version: Psalms Chapter
When  went out of , the house of  from a people of strange language;

  was his , and  his dominion.

 The sea saw it, and fled:  was driven back.

 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou , that thou wast driven back?

 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?

 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of ;

 Which turned the  into a standing water, the  into a  of waters.
