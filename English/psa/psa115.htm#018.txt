Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give , for thy , and for thy truth's sake.

 Wherefore should the  say, Where is now their God?

 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.

 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:

 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:

 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.

 O , trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their .

 O house of , trust in the LORD: he is their help and their .

 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their .

 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will  us; he will  the house of ; he will  the house of .

 He will  them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.

 But we will  the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
