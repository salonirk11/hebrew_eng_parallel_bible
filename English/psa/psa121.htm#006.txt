King James Version: Psalms Chapter
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.

 My help cometh from the LORD, which made  and earth.

 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.

 Behold, he that keepeth  shall neither slumber nor sleep.

 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.

 The  shall not smite thee by day, nor the  by night.

 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.

 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
