King James Version: Psalms Chapter
If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may  say;

 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

 Our soul is escaped as a  out of the  of the fowlers: the  is broken, and we are escaped.

 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made  and earth.
