When the LORD turned again the  of , we were like them that .

 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the , The LORD hath done great things for them.

 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
