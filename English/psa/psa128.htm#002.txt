King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful  by the sides of thine house: thy children like  plants round about thy table.

 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.

 The LORD shall  thee out of : and thou shalt see the good of  all the days of thy life.

 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon .
