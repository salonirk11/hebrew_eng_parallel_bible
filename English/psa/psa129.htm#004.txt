King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may  now say:

 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate .

 Let them be as the  upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:

 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his .

 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we  you in the name of the LORD.
