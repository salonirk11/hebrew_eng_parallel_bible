King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

 Let  hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
