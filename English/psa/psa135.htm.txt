King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.

 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.

 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.

 For the LORD hath   unto himself, and  for his  treasure.

 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.

 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in , and in earth, in the seas, and all  places.

 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.

 Who smote the firstborn of , both of man and .

 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O , upon , and upon all his servants.

 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

   of the , and   of , and all the kingdoms of :

 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto  his people.

 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

 For the LORD will  his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.

 The idols of the  are  and , the work of men's hands.

 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;

 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.

 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.

  the LORD, O house of :  the LORD, O house of :

  the LORD, O house of : ye that fear the LORD,  the LORD.

 Blessed be the LORD out of , which dwelleth at . Praise ye the LORD.
