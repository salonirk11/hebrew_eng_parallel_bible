King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;

 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.

 They have sharpened their tongues like a ; adders'  is under their lips. .

 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

 The proud have hid a  for me, and cords; they have spread a  by the wayside; they have set gins for me. .

 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.

 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. .

 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into  pits, that they rise not up again.

 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the .

 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
