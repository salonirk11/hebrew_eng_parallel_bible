King James Version: Psalms Chapter
Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his : praise him in the  of his power.

 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.

 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the  and .

 Praise him with the  and : praise him with stringed instruments and organs.

 Praise him upon the loud : praise him upon the high sounding .

 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
