King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter
I am the rose of , and the  of the valleys.

 As the  among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

 As the  tree among the trees of the , so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his  with great delight, and his  was sweet to my taste.

 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his  over me was love.

 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.

 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

 I charge you, O ye daughters of , by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

 My beloved is like a  or a young : behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the .

 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

 For, lo, the winter is past, the  is over and gone;

 The  appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

 The  tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender  give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

 O my , that art in the clefts of the , in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.

 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a  or a young  upon the mountains of .
