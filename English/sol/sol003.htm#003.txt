King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter
By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the  of her that conceived me.

 I charge you, O ye daughters of , by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

 Who is this that cometh out of the  like pillars of smoke, perfumed with  and , with all powders of the ?

 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of .

 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his  upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

   made himself a  of the  of .

 He made the pillars thereof of , the bottom thereof of , the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of .

 Go forth, O ye daughters of , and behold   with the  wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
