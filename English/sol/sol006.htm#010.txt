King James Version: Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of , to feed in the , and to gather lilies.

 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as , terrible as an army with banners.

 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from .

 Thy teeth are as a flock of  which go up from the , whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one  among them.

 As a piece of a  are thy temples within thy locks.

 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

 My , my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the , clear as the , and terrible as an army with banners?

 I went down into the garden of  to see the fruits of the , and to see whether the  flourished and the pomegranates budded.

 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of .

 Return, return, O ; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the ? As it were the company of two armies.
