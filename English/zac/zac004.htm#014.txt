 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a  all of , with a  upon the top of it, and his  lamps thereon, and  pipes to the  lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

 And two  trees by it, one upon the right side of the , and the other upon the left side thereof.

 So I answered and spake to the  that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
