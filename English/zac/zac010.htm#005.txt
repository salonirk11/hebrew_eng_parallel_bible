 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no .

 Mine  was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of , and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.

 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the , out of him the battle , out of him every oppressor together.

 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.
